description: 审查当前改动是否存在过度设计，列出可删内容
---

Review the current code changes for over-engineering only, not correctness. One line per finding: L<line>: <tag> <what to cut>. <replacement>. Tags: delete (dead code/speculative feature), stdlib (reinvented standard library), native (dependency doing what the platform does), yagni (abstraction with one implementation), shrink (same logic, fewer lines). End with the net lines removable. If nothing to cut: 'Lean already. Ship.'
